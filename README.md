# Online Sales Data Visualization

After cleaing dataset from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shreyanshverma27/online-sales-dataset-popular-marketplace-data/data) , I have created a tableau dashboard for it;.

The analysis focuses on:
1. Sales trends over time
2. Popular categories in different regions
3. Impact of payment methods on sales
4. Popular products based on units sold

## Total Revenue Generated Graph
This graph provides insights into the total revenue generated by sales over a specified time period. The dashboard filter is set from 01/01/24 to 04/01/24 (mm/dd/yy), and the scale is for each day. This helps in understanding the change in units sold or revenue generated on a particular day. For example, on March 26, the highest revenue was generated compared to other days in the range.

## Popular Category in a Region
This visualization identifies the most popular category among three regions: Asia, North America, and Europe, based on units sold. It can be observed that the most popular category is clothing, with Asia buying the most.

## Popular Product 
The tree map helps identify which products are sold more than others. There is a filter to change the number of units sold, which can help understand if products are not selling well, so we can market them more.
