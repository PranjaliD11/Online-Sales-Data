# Online Sales Data Visualization

I have created visualization on dataset found on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shreyanshverma27/online-sales-dataset-popular-marketplace-data/data) to get insights on online sales data, I have focused on analyzing sales trend over time, then finding out popular categories over different regions and findng out impact of payment methods on sales along with keeping track of popular products solds based on the units sold. 

## Total Revenue Generated Graph
It gives us insights on total revenue generated by sales for a particular given time. In the dashboard I have set filter from 01/01/24- 04/01/24(mm/dd/yy) and the scale is for each day, which helps understanding the change in units sold or revenue generated based on a particular day. Like on March 26 we had highest revenue generated as compared to other days in the range.
