# Online Sales Data Visualization

I have created visualization on dataset found on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shreyanshverma27/online-sales-dataset-popular-marketplace-data/data) to get insights on online sales data, I have focused on analyzing sales trend over time, then finding out popular categories over different regions and findng out impact of payment methods on sales along with keeping track of popular products solds based on the units sold.
